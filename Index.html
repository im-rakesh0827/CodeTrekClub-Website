                        A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain
                        stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency
                        systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a
                        blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for
                        a trusted third party.

                        Lately, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is a hot topic in the tech industry. Perhaps more than our daily
                        lives Artificial Intelligence (AI) is impacting the business world more. There was about $300 million in venture capital
                        invested in AI startups in 2014, a 300% increase than a year before (Bloomberg).
                        Hey there! This blog is almost about 1000+ words long and may take ~5 mins to go through the whole thing. We understand
                        that you might not have that much time.
                        This is precisely why we made a short video on the topic. It is less than 2 mins, and simplifies Artificial intelligence
                        & Machine learning. We hope this helps you learn more and save your time. Cheers!
                        You will get to learn so many stuff over here.
                        So keep in touch with us you will be able to understand all the technical stuff over here.
